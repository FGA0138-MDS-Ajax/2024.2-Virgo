# Introduction: What is this document
This folder is meant to store source files and documentation files 
on the development of the CVAI (CuidarVerdeIA, AKA osirisAI). 
This readme file contains the following descriptions:

- Technologies
- Deployment and training instructions
- Used Datasets
- TODO

# Technologies used
This section expands on technologies used and the reason they're 
chosen. This section is organized using the following structure:

Computer Language > Frameworks

## Python
Python was carefully chosen as a language for this AI project for these
main reasons:
- Standard
- Portability
- Ease of use
- Team Knowledge and Know-How

Chosing any other language would impose a learning curve. A 
learning curve takes time to path through. Time is of the essence.
And we are running very low on such essence. And running out of
essence, for all intents and purposes, means failure, therefore, 
dishonor and death.

### TensorFlow and TensorFlowDatasets
Google in this moment is a too-big-to-fail company, meaning 
using a framework developed by google imposes very little risk
on the development of this project. As google cared to implement version
compatibility, this also imposes little or no risk to future maintainability.
Very great. 
Also, this framework has almost no learning curve, meaning rapid development.

It was chosen for these main reasons.
